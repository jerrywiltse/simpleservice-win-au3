SimpleService is an application I created with AutoIt to automate the process of using windows toolkit apps known as "IntSrv" and "SrvAny" to run an executable file as a windows service. Actually, it is really a GUI for SrvAny and eliminates the need for IntServ. SrvAny is zipped up and will be extracted at runtime. The official process is documented here:
